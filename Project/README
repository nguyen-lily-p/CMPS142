CMPS 142: Machine Learning
Project: Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews
07 December 2018

~Project Description~
Our model first uses TFIDF, lemmatization, and n-gram methods to pre-process 
and extract features from the training and testing data before sending it to 
a voting ensemble of three classifers: Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Linear SVC.
K-Fold Cross Validation was also used to check model's ability to generalize instances.

~Program Instructions~
To run the program, type the following into the command line:
      $ python main.py
      
There optionals that can be specified or change through the command line or by editing the program itself:
   If running by command line, the following options and arguments have been implemented:
     - '--train [trainFile]': sets training file to specified path; must be a csv file
            the default value is "train.csv"
     - '--test [testFile]': sets test file to specified path; must be a csv file
            the default value is "test.csv"
      - '--out [outFile]': sets output file to specified path; must be a csv file
            the default value is "output.csv"
      - '--perf [perfFile]': sets performance metrics output to specified path; must be a text file
            the default value is "output_performance.txt"
   OR

   Open main.py in a text editor and change file path variables, listed near the top, as needed before running: 
      - TRAINING_DATA_PATH -> training data file path
      - TESTING_DATA_PATH -> testing data file path
      - OUTPUT_PATH -> predictions output file path
      - OUTPUT_PERFORMANCE_PATH -> performance metrics output file path


To run performance metrics script, uncomment code at bottom of main function.
Note that this will make the program's runtime about 10 minutes, and has therefore been commented out as default.

This program requires the Natural Languages Toolkit (NLTK) library, and must be downloaded before running the program.
The user can install it directly, or simply uncomment the line "nltk.download()" near the top of the main.py script.

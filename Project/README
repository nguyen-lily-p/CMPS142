CMPS 142: Machine Learning
Project: Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews
07 December 2018

~Project Description~
Our model first uses TFIDF, lemmatization, and n-gram methods to pre-process 
and extract features from the training and testing data before sending it to 
a voting ensemble of three classifers: Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Linear SVC.
K-Fold Cross Validation was also used to check model's ability to generalize instances.

~Program Instructions~
Open main.py in a text editor and change file paths as needed before running: 
   - TRAINING_DATA_PATH -> training file
   - TESTING_DATA_PATH -> testing file
   - OUTPUT_PATH -> predictions file
   - OUTPUT_PERFORMANCE_PATH -> performance metrics file

OR

If running by command line, the following arguments have been implemented:
   - '--train [trainFile]': sets training file to specified path
   - '--test [testFile]': sets test file to specified path
   - '--out [outFile]': sets output file to specified path
   - '--perf [perfFile]': sets performance metrics output to specified path

To run performance metrics script, uncomment code at bottom of main function.

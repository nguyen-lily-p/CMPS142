Assignment 3, Problem 2: Implementing KNN


#### PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: ####

Implement the KNN algorithm in Python and submit your code.
Your code must handle the following parameters to be defined as input:
    - K
    - different distance measures: L1, L2, or Linf
Your code should run using the following command:
    $ python <YourCodeName>.py --K <integer value> --method <L1, L2, or Linf>



#### THOUGHTS: ####

- The overall process will run like this:
    1. read/set parameters from command line option arguments
    2. read in/store all training data
    3. read testing data; for every test instance:
        - look through training data to find the k nearest neighbors
	- predict label for the test instance
	- check if prediction is correct

- what's the best way to store all of the training data? (i.e. data structure)
    - does this depend on the distance measure we're using?
    - does this depend on the number of dimensions of the data?

- output:
    - prediction label for every test instance
    - actual label for every test instance
    - statistics: accuracy
    - list of the k nearest neighbors for each test instance?

Assignment 4: Implementing Logistic Regression

***** 1.1: Logistic Regression *****

LogisticRegression.java

In this program, we have implemented vanilla Logistic Regression.
We were given the training file and the starter code, and we filled in the
sections marked with TODO's.
This program can be run by compiling the .java file and then running the Java 
    interpreter.


***** 1.2: Logistic Regression with Bias *****

LogisticRegression_withBias.java

In this program, we have implemented Logistic Regression with a bias term.
We were given the training file and starter code, and we filled in the sections
    marked with TODO's.
This program can be run by compiling the .java file and then running the Java
    interpreter.


***** 1.3: Logistic Regression with Regularization *****

LogisticRegression_withRegularization.java

In this program, we have implemented Logistic Regression with L2 regularization.
We were given the training and testing files and starter code, and we filled in
    the sections marked with TODO's.
This program can be run by compiling the .java file and then running the Java
    interpreter.
